Coruja Remote
=============

Coruja Remote is a universal, multimodal remote control developed by FalaBrasil
Group at Federal University of Par√° (UFPA), Brazil. Conventional, universal
remote control devices or apps on the smartphone, force the use of hands by the
user, which can be cumbersome or even impossible, specially for people with
special needs. Coruja Remote accepts both voice commands and head poses as input
commands, which turns itself a good -- and maybe the only one -- solution for
visually or motor impaired people.

HPE stands for Head Pose Estimation
